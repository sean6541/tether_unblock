# Tether Unblock

Some mobile network operators block tethering. This Magisk module fixes the TTL values of all packets routed through your phone and thus your carrier cannot distinguish packets originating from a tethered device from those originating from your phone. As a byproduct, this also hides your tethering data usage from your carrier.

## How to install:
